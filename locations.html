		<h3>Locations</h3>
	<dd>Seals are found worldwide, particularly in the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, but also inhabit temperate and some tropical coastal regions. They can be found on all continents and are highly dependent on marine habitats, though some species live in freshwater like Lake Baikal.  
Cold and polar regions
Antarctic: Several species, such as the crabeater, Weddell, and leopard seals, live in Antarctica and surrounding subantarctic islands. 
Arctic: Various species, including the harp, ringed, and bearded seals, are found in the Arctic region. 
Temperate and coastal waters
North Atlantic: Gray and harbor seals are common along the coasts of North America, Europe, and Asia. 
Pacific: Harbor seals can be found along the coasts of North America and Asia. 
Other coastlines: Seals live along the coasts of Australia, South America, and southern Africa. 
Tropical and freshwater habitats
Tropical: The Hawaiian monk seal lives in the Hawaiian Islands, and the Mediterranean monk seal is found in the Mediterranean Sea. 
Freshwater: The Baikal seal is an exception, living its entire life in Lake Baikal, a freshwater lake in Siberia. </dd>

<h1>Weddell Seal</h1>
<dd>Weddell seals are commonly found on fast ice, or ice fastened to land, and gather in small groups around cracks and holes within the ice. In the winter, they stay in the water to avoid blizzards, with only their heads poking through breathing holes in the ice.</dd>
<dd>Weddell seals are primarily found around Antarctica, particularly on fast ice that is attached to the coast. They have also been spotted as far north as Patagonia, New Zealand, and some subantarctic islands.</dd>
